I am a first year mathematics PhD supervised by [Rachael Boyd](https://www.maths.gla.ac.uk/~rboyd/) and [Jim Belk](https://jimbelk.github.io/web/).

My research interests include group theory, geometric group theory and algebraic topology, with focus on Artin and Coxeter groups.

I am currently working on the isomorphism problem between Artin and Dual Artin Groups.
